The Factory Design Pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class. 
Instead, a factory method handles object creation, allowing for flexibility and decoupling. 
This pattern is useful when the type of objects to be created are determined dynamically
and it promotes code reusability, modularity, and separation of concerns, making applications easier to maintain and extend.
